## Who Am I?

My name is Joshua Jesudhason (s3862115), s3862115@student.rmit.edu.au. Studying Informational Technology at RMIT keeps me sitting down for many hours during the week, with this I make sure my fitness is kept in check with spending my spare time socializing and playing soccer on weekends.


### Journey

Technology is continuously changing the way we are living, with the ever-growing industry evolving us and the way we view everyday life. Growing up I was a sporty kid who loved gaming, I learnt from team sports that a team can change and get manipulated by the people in the organization. The principal of a product which can be transformed due to what is in it sparked my interest to learn the foundation and details of an object. After graduating I would like to find a career in software engineering



### District 1

Console gaming was the foundation of relationships and created the love for gaming for millions of people around the world but unfortunately that love has slowly been extinguished. For my project which is called District 1 is to develop a game in which allows people to gain the spark they got from their fondest childhood memories. The project will entail a team-oriented 5v5 multiplayer console game. The game will consist of many different champions with various abilities which can be picked. The aim of the project is to gain the love in which many people experienced to when console gaming was first invented.


Unlike League of legends and overwatch, District 1 will involve a campaign guiding user into the in-depth stories of the different champions. The online multiplayer will include a team vs team fight with the goal to destroy the other teamâ€™s base. The game will entail a less sci fi approach to overwatch which means gamers will feel a real-life approach to the game. Each champion is designed for different moments in the game, for instance District 1 will utilize champions such as tanks, assassin, medic, marksman, fighters and supports with each designed for different team fights. Competitive gaming in District 1 will follow a ranked tier in the order, Rookie, Bronze, Gold, Ace, Master, Pro and Platinum. Each player begins with a choice of character selection where they can pick either as a tank, assassin, medic, marksman, fighter or a support where, in which a storyline occurs. Storylines help create a relationship between the player and champion. Throughout the beginning of the storyline players get to personalize their abilities to how they would want to play the game, this allows players to get the fantasy of themselves in the game. After the tutorial is completed players can vs players online in a 5v5 fight in a battle to destroy the enemy base. The game will include different maps in which the matches be played with each game involving 7 rounds of attacking and 7 rounds of defending. 


### Motivation

For every individual gaming has a different role in their life, from couch gaming to competitive gaming. In the world there are currently 2.5 billion gamers who have spent $152.1 billion in 2019 with a scheduled increase of 9.6% per year. My project will follow a similar set up like league of legends which currently sits at 115 million players and overwatch which is currently sitting at 40 million players. With this high demand for team gaming the project is considered interesting and could spark a high revenue.
