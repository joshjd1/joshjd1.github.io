## Welcome to GitHub Pages

My name is Joshua Jesudhason (s3862115), s3862115@student.rmit.edu.au. Studying Informational Technology at RMIT keeps me sitting down for many hours during the week, with this I make sure my fitness is kept in check with spending my spare time socializing and playing soccer on weekends.
